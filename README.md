Make a simple HTML website and publish it using Github Pages.  
Borrowed from: https://zirafa.github.io/simple-website-template/

## How does this work?
This website template uses CSS & JS to hide and show different parts of index.html and uses Github Pages to render the website from the gh-pages branch.
